## About The Project

Sustainable Development Goal number five aims is to achieve gender equality and empower all
women and girls. According to the UN gender equality is not only a fundamental human right but a necessary foundation for not only a prosperous and peaceful but also a sustainable world.

The Kurunzi La Jamii therefore, seeks to make available this critical information and making available a platform for discussion and dialogue centred on Sexual and Reproductive Health, Women Rights and socio-economic empowerment of the pastoralist girls.
The solution will provide a web application, a mobile application and a USSD platform for
dissemination of information and also feedback mechanism. The Kurunzi app will link girls to
mentors, experts, legal assistance and other women especially from the community who have
succeeded against the stigma. It will also give alerts and notifications on cases of FGM/C, early marriage domestic violence reported by members of the community. 

Other services like links to scholarship providers, health services providers, government
procurement, company registration and e-citizen will also be provided.
